IRIS-HEP aims to develop the state of the art software cyberinfrastructure required for the challenges of data intensive scientific research at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN, and other planned HEP experiments of the 2020’s. These facilities are discovery machines which aim to understand the fundamental building blocks of nature and their interactions.

The long term sustainability of our software efforts and science depends on a pipeline of software enabled scientists and engineers. We have implemented a scalable community basic software training program in collaboration with the HEP Software Foundation and FIRST-HEP (OAC-1829707, OAC-1829729). A large summer student program has trained more than 100 students and the annual Computational and Data Science for HEP (CoDaS-HEP) summer school provides more advanced training. A separate outreach program in partnership with QuarkNet aims to developing coding skills in high school teachers and students.
