Goals achieved:
\begin{itemize}
\item Build an international community around training for particle, nuclear and astroparticle physics and a common model for a multi-step/tiered evolution of training (See Training Pyramid)
\item Develop a Carpentries-style curriculum relevant for that community and widely-used by the international community
\item With the community execute both introductory training activities in the US and internationally and an advanced US summer school (CoDaS-HEP), with specific individuals progressing through multiple training activities. Clear examples of individuals eventually contributing to widely used research software (via the IRIS-HEP software institute, e.g. Scikit-HEP, mkFit, or via experiments such as CMS or LHCb)
\item 1016 people trained to date (with 175 instructors engaged), a mix of many in-person and virtual training events (COVID-driven/limited) â†’ students become instructors and mentors
\item Current focus is scalability and sustainability of these activities

The annual Computational and Data Science for HEP (CoDaS-HEP) summer school at Princeton provides more advanced training and helps build a larger ``cohort'' experience among graduate students and postdocs. The 5th school in July, 2023 involved more than 50 students and postdocs and a dozen lecturers. Topics covered include Parallel Programming, Advanced Data Science Tools and Techniques, Machine Learning - Technology and Methods and practical skills such as performance evaluation and collaborative use of git/github.
